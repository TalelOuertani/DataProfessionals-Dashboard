## Problem Statement

The objective of this project was to analyze survey data collected from data professionals to understand their demographics, job satisfaction, and key factors influencing their career choices. The goal was to transform raw survey data into actionable insights that could help organizations in the data industry better understand the needs and preferences of their workforce.


### Steps followed 

- Step1: Data Collection:

    Downloaded the survey data from a GitHub repository.

- Step2: Data Transformation:

    Used Power Query to clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values and standardizing data formats.

- Step3: Dashboard Creation:

    -  First Page: General Breakdown:

         - Used a card to visualize the total number of survey respondents.
         - Used a card to display the average age of the respondents.
         - Used a treemap to map the geographic distribution of survey takers.
         - Created a bar chart to show the average salary across different job titles.
        - Used a column chart to chart the favorite programming languages among respondents.
        - Compared average salary by sex using a donut chart.
        - Identified key factors in job search priorities using a pie chart.
    
    - Second Page: Breakdown by Job Title:

        - Used a card to display the average age and salary for different job titles.
        - Assessed the difficulty of breaking into the data industry for each job role using a donut chart.
        - Visualized the industry distribution among respondents using a column chart.
       -  Measured levels of happiness with work/life balance, salary, and learning opportunities by job title using a gauge.
